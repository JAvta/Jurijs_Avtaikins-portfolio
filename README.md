## Project Overview

For this project, I have built a portfolio website. I was provided with a design mockup as a PDF-file, and I have replicated that design in HTML and CSS. I have developed a responsive website that displays images, descriptions and links to some of the portfolio projects I completed through the course of my Nanodegree program.
